# Deployment Status 📋

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Frontend application (Next.js + TypeScript)
- [x] Smart contracts (TokenFactory + FurchillToken)
- [x] UI/UX design and animations
- [x] Wallet integration (RainbowKit)
- [x] Form validation and error handling
- [x] Network switching support
- [x] Deployment scripts
- [x] Environment configuration
- [x] Documentation

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Smart contract deployment to testnets
- [ ] Factory address updates in frontend
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **Deploy contracts to testnets** (when ready)
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network goerli
   ```

2. **Update factory addresses** in `components/TokenDeployer.tsx`
   - Replace placeholder addresses with real deployed addresses

3. **Test the complete flow**
   - Deploy a test token
   - Verify all functionality works

## 🚀 Current Status
**Frontend**: Ready for deployment to Vercel
**Smart Contracts**: Ready for testnet deployment
**Integration**: Complete (just needs real contract addresses)

## 📍 Important Notes
- The frontend will work perfectly on Vercel
- Token deployment will fail until contracts are deployed and addresses are updated
- Users can still interact with the UI and see the form validation
- All other features (wallet connection, network switching, etc.) work immediately
